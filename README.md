## Overview

Welcome to Base_n, an exciting Next.js web application that tests your
skills in converting numbers across different number systems!

In this game, you'll face a series of questions designed to challenge
both your knowledge and speed. Each question offers four answer
options, but only one is correct.

Bewareâ€”the clock is ticking! Your score depends on your accuracy and
how quickly you respond; the less time you have left, the lower your
score will be.

The game continues indefinitely, and you will lose if you run out of
lives, so play wisely as you start with three lives.

What makes Base_n truly exciting is that each question is generated
randomly, ensuring that every game is a fresh challenge as you convert
from one number system to another!
